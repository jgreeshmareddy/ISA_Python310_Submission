# ISA_Python310_Submission
ISA Interpreter using isolated Python 3.10

This project demonstrates an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
compiler and interpreter implemented in Python.

Python Environment:
- Python Version: 3.10
- Python is installed in an isolated folder (python310/)
- System Python is not used

Steps to Run:
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to isa_work folder
3. Use the isolated Python interpreter:

   ..\python310\python.exe compiler.py program.asm program.machine
   ..\python310\python.exe interpreter.py program.machine out.json

Output:
- Machine code is generated in program.machine
- Execution result is stored in out.json
